# Project Title

Voice to text and vice versa

The presented web application leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive platform for voice-to-text and text-to-voice functionalities. The user interface consists of input fields, buttons, and output areas strategically designed using CSS for a visually appealing and responsive layout. The integration of the Web Speech API in JavaScript enables seamless voice recognition and text-to-speech conversion. Users can initiate voice input, observe the recognized text in real-time, input text for speech synthesis, and experience the converted speech output. The website offers an intuitive and engaging experience, fostering efficient communication through the integration of browser-based speech technologies.

The website is live on github pages, try it out!
